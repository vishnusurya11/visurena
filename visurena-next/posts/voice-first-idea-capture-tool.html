        <p>When working on a project, getting your requirements across should be easy. For most of us, it's often quicker and clearer to say what we want out loud, instead of writing it all down. That's the motivation behind the tool I built.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #3b82f6; margin-top: 2rem;">How It Works</h2>

        <p>This tool lets you speak your requirements directly. It records your voice, transcribes what you say, and gives you a written version of your idea. From there, you can quickly refine or hand it off to an AI (like ChatGPT or a cloud service) to make the text more professional or actionable.</p>

        <p>Here's the flow:</p>

        <ol style="color: #b3b3b3;">
            <li>Click 'Live Recording' to start.</li>
            <li>Choose your recording input, select a model, and hit record.</li>
            <li>When you're done, the tool generates a transcript of your spoken requirement.</li>
            <li>You can take that text and use AI to polish or rephrase it for better clarity.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 style="color: #3b82f6; margin-top: 2rem;">More Than Just Live Recording</h2>

        <p>There's also a file upload feature. If you already have audio or video files, you can upload them:</p>

        <ul style="color: #b3b3b3;">
            <li>The tool automatically separates the audio from video (if needed).</li>
            <li>It transcribes the audio into text.</li>
            <li>You can process multiple files at once and save all transcripts to a chosen folder.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #3b82f6; margin-top: 2rem;">Why I Built It</h2>

        <p>This tool is designed for simplicity. My goal is to make capturing requirements as effortless as possibleâ€”just talk, upload, and let the tool handle the rest. No more worrying about forgetting details or struggling to type out long ideas.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #3b82f6; margin-top: 2rem;">Where It's Going</h2>

        <p>Right now, the tool is basic but functional. I plan to keep it lightweight and straightforward, focusing on fast, accurate transcripts and easy integration with AI services for text improvement. Whether you're brainstorming, gathering requirements, or just organizing your thoughts, this tool is meant to make the process faster and easier.</p>
