# 🎨 Design Auditor — Claude Skill

A Claude skill that audits designs against **19 professional design categories** — built for developers, non-designers, and anyone who wants expert design validation without needing to know the rules themselves.

Works with **Figma files** (via Figma MCP), **code** (HTML/CSS/React/Vue), **screenshots**, **wireframes**, and written descriptions. Supports **English and Korean**.

Compatible with **Claude**, **Manus**, and other agents that support SKILL.md-based skills.

---

## What It Does

Drop in a Figma link, paste your CSS, upload a screenshot, or share a wireframe — Design Auditor checks your work against 19 categories of design rules and gives you:

- A **score out of 100** with per-category breakdown (with mini bar chart per row)
- A separate **Accessibility Score** (WCAG coverage across Cat 2, 6, 7, 15, 16)
- A separate **Ethics Score** (dark patterns and manipulative design across Cat 18)
- A separate **Usability Score** (Cat 19 — H1/H2/H3/H6/H7/H10, with Nielsen cross-reference for H4/H5/H8/H9)
- A **🚫 Blocker tier** for legal/compliance violations (WCAG AA, GDPR, PECR) — separate from Critical issues
- Issues ranked by severity (🚫 Blocker / 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning / 🟢 Tip)
- **Color blindness context** — every failing color pair annotated with the affected blindness type
- **SVG accessibility checks** — decorative vs. meaningful SVG patterns, aria-hidden, role="img"
- **Design System detection** — MUI, Chakra, shadcn/ui, Ant Design, Radix, Bootstrap (system-specific fixes)
- **Figma Auto Layout scan** — detects frames using manual positioning where Auto Layout should be used
- **Plain-language explanations** of *why* each rule matters
- **"Teach Me" mode** — explains the design principles behind your top 3 issues, not just the fixes
- An **Issue Priority Matrix** — every issue plotted by effort vs. impact
- Before/after code diffs when fixing issues in HTML/CSS/React/Vue
- Direct fixes in your **Figma file** via Figma MCP
- **Figma Code Connect** — detects design-to-code mapping gaps (`get_code_connect_suggestions`)
- **Wireframe to Spec** — converts wireframes into annotated dev-ready specs
- **Visual audit report** exportable to Canva for stakeholder sharing
- **Developer handoff report** — CSS spec table, a11y checklist, critical fixes
- **Export report as Markdown** — ready for Notion, GitHub, Linear, or Jira

"Any dark patterns here?" → ethics audit
"Wireframe to spec" → annotated dev-ready spec from wireframe
```

**Korean:**
```
"디자인 검토해줘" → 전체 감사
"접근성 확인해줘" → 접근성 중심 감사
"내 디자인 괜찮아 보여?" → 전체 감사
"UI 검토해줘" → 전체 감사
"색상 대비 확인해줘" → 색상 및 접근성 감사
"와이어프레임 스펙 출력해줘" → 와이어프레임 스펙 모드
```

## Example Output

```
## 🔍 Design Audit Report

**Input:** Checkout flow · 3 frames
**Type:** Figma MCP
**Confidence:** 🟢 High
**Component health:** 71% coverage · 2 detached instances · 8 unnamed layers
**Code Connect:** 8 components mapped · 3 unmapped

### Overall Score: 62/100
100 − (1 × 🚫 12) − (2 × 🔴 8) − (4 × 🟡 4) − (2 × 🟢 1) = 62/100
A legal compliance failure and contrast issues are the main drag.

### Accessibility Score: 55/100 — significant gaps ⚠️ Contains legal compliance failures
### Ethics Score: 85/100 — minor concerns

### 🚫 Blockers (−12pts each)
- **Text contrast failure** — #aaa on white = 2.3:1 → Fix: use #595959 (7:1)
  Legal basis: WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.3

### 🔴 Critical Issues (−8pts each)
- **Missing form labels** — placeholder-only inputs lose label on type
  → Fix: add <label> above each input.

### 🟡 Warnings (−4pts each)
- **Off-grid spacing** — padding: 13px → Fix: use 12px or 16px
- **CTA hierarchy inversion** — "Accept all" primary, "Reject all" grey text
  → Fix: equivalent visual weight (GDPR requirement)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v1.2.10

**Dev Handoff Report, Wireframe to Spec — restructured. Korean coverage for both.**

**Dev Handoff Report restructured:**
- `━━━` dividers between all sections for consistent visual separation
- Blockers separated into their own section (`🚫 BLOCKERS — fix before any other work`) above Critical Fixes — previously grouped together
- All four scores in the metadata table: Overall, A11y, Ethics, Usability (with conditional notes for Ethics and Usability)
- Code Connect mapping table included in template
- Consistent `━━━`-wrapped footer

**Wireframe to Spec restructured:**
- All 8 sections now have `━━━` dividers with emoji headers (📐 📏 🔤 🧩 ✍️ 🖱️ ♿ ❓)
- Context notes moved into section headers directly after each `━━━` block, instead of scattered inline

**Korean support added for both:**
- Dev Handoff Report — Korean note block: title, all 6 field labels, all 7 section headers, all 12 table column headers, footer
- Wireframe to Spec — bilingual footer lines + Korean note block: title, field labels, all 8 section headers with context notes, table column headers

**README:**
- v1.0.0–v1.2.4 changelog entries collapsed into a `<details>` block

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v1.2.9

**Korean language coverage — full audit pass**

Audited all changes made since v1.2.4 for missing Korean support and filled every gap found.

**SKILL.md gaps fixed:**

- **Category 19 checklist** — All 19 heuristic checklist items now have bilingual labels (e.g. "Async button feedback / 비동기 버튼 피드백")
- **Category 19 triggers** — Korean trigger phrases added: "휴리스틱 검토", "닐슨 감사", "사용성 휴리스틱", "H1/H2/H6 확인"
- **Usability Score bands** — All four bands now bilingual: "Heuristically sound / 사용성 기준 충족", "Minor gaps / 사소한 사용성 문제", etc.
- **Usability Score note in report** — Korean version: "H4(일관성), H5(오류 예방), H8(미적 디자인), H9(오류 복구)는 각각 Cat 5, 7, 4, 11/12에서 다룹니다."
- **URL report header** — Korean format added for all URL-type audits (라이브 URL, 신뢰도, 제한사항)
- **Wireframe spec fidelity line** — Korean added: "값은 권장사항이며 실측값이 아닙니다"

**`heuristics.md` Korean support added:**

- **Korean terminology table** — 22 key UX terms with Korean equivalents (사용성 휴리스틱, 로딩 상태, 진행 표시기, 온보딩, 일괄 작업, etc.)
- **Korean severity labels** — 🚫 차단 · 🔴 심각 · 🟡 경고 · 🟢 팁
- **Korean heuristic note** — Standard report note translated
- **Usability Score bands** — All four bands bilingual in the ref file
- **Quick Reference Checklist** — All 19 checklist items translated (e.g. "비동기 작업 버튼에 로딩 상태 있음", "파괴적 작업에 확인 대화상자 있음")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v1.2.8

**Heuristics.md coverage — no loose ends.**

- Scope declaration (H4/H5/H8/H9 explicitly excluded with reasons)
- Usability Score model with bands
- H1 gaps — async button loading state, form success confirmation, multi-step progress indicator
- H2 — jargon/error code detection, icon meaning mismatch, locale-aware date/number formats
- H3 gaps — modal close mechanism, flow back navigation, destructive action confirmation
- H6 — icon-only nav, disappearing floating labels, dropdown selection visibility
- H7 — keyboard shortcut hints, bulk action support, preference persistence
- H10 — helper text on complex fields, actionable error messages, contextual tooltips, onboarding guidance
- Quick reference checklist covering all 6 heuristics

Every entry has: definition, why it matters, Figma detection, code detection, severity, fix, and context note.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v1.2.7

**URL inputs — full support added**

The skill now recognises and audits from any URL type, not just Figma links.

| URL Type | Confidence | How it's handled |
|---|---|---|
| Live website (`https://...`) | 🟡 Medium | `web_fetch`, login handling, multi-page offer |
| Vercel / Netlify preview | 🟡 Medium | Same as live website |
| GitHub file URL | 🟢 High | Converts to raw URL, full code audit |
| GitHub repo URL | 🟡 Medium | Browses key files, scope selector widget |
| CodeSandbox / StackBlitz | 🟡–🟢 | Source if accessible, preview fallback |
| CodePen | 🟡 Medium | Debug URL fetch, source extraction |
| Storybook | 🟡 Medium | Component/variant detection from URL path |

Each URL type has a dedicated spec: how to fetch, what confidence to set, what limitations to declare in the report header, how to handle login walls, and what to offer the user after the audit.

GitHub file URLs get full 🟢 High confidence — raw source is treated identically to pasted code. All other URL types get 🟡 Medium with explicit limitation notes in the report header.

**Agent compliance — mandatory output enforcement**

Following reports of third-party agents (e.g. TRAE Solo) producing free-form UX reviews instead of scored reports, two mandatory enforcement notices were added:

- `⚠️ OUTPUT FORMAT IS MANDATORY — DO NOT DEVIATE` at the top of Step 2
- `⚠️ MANDATORY — ALL AGENTS — NO EXCEPTIONS` at the top of the Strict Output Template

Both explicitly prohibit substituting a generic critique for the scored report. Skipping the score is never acceptable — agents must estimate and flag with 🟡 Medium confidence if uncertain.

**Input widget updated** — "Live URL" and "GitHub URL" added as input type options alongside Figma, Screenshot, and Code.

**All version stamps updated** — report footers now correctly show v1.2.7.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v1.2.6

**Wireframe to Spec mode**

New output mode alongside the standard audit. When a wireframe is detected (greyscale, box placeholders, skeleton fidelity), the skill offers Spec mode before running a scored audit.

Produces a structured design specification: Layout & Dimensions, Spacing, Typography, Components Required (with states), Copy Placeholders, Interaction Notes, Accessibility Requirements, and an Open Questions section that surfaces gaps the wireframe doesn't answer.

- No score or severity labels — Spec mode annotates, it doesn't audit
- Estimated values clearly flagged with `~` prefix
- Uses Figma layer data when available; falls back to standard defaults from reference files
- Output as downloadable `.md` file
- Auto-detected from wireframe input; also available in "What next?" widget post-audit
- Triggers on: "wireframe to spec", "annotate my wireframe", "turn this wireframe into a spec", "spec out this design"

**Canva visual audit report**

After any audit, "Export to Canva" generates a visual report card in Canva — score rings, issue summary, top 3 fixes, positives. Stakeholder-friendly format for sharing with non-technical audiences. Separate from the full technical Markdown export.

**Trigger vocabulary expanded**

Wireframe-specific trigger phrases added to YAML description. Stale version stamps in report templates fixed (were showing v1.2.2).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v1.2.5

**Figma MCP — three new tools integrated**

- **`get_code_connect_suggestions`** — AI-suggested Figma→code component mappings. Enriches Cat 5 and Cat 17. Flags unmapped components. Adds Code Connect line to report header.
- **`get_code_connect_map`** — confirmed mappings, powers the handoff table
- **`create_design_system_rules`** — generates enforcement rules for the repo, offered post-audit when token/component health is poor. Always requires explicit confirmation.

**Scoring calibration — Blocker tier**

| Severity | Deduction | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| 🚫 Blocker | −12pts | Legal/compliance — WCAG AA, GDPR, PECR |
| 🔴 Critical | −8pts | Usability failure |
| 🟡 Warning | −4pts | Degrades experience |
| 🟢 Tip | −1pt | Polish |

Blocker examples: contrast below 4.5:1 (SC 1.4.3), keyboard-inaccessible element (SC 2.1.1), missing alt (SC 1.1.1), pre-checked marketing consent (GDPR), skip link missing (SC 2.4.1).

Accessibility Score updated: Blockers use −12. Any Blocker appends "⚠️ Contains legal compliance failures".

**Trigger vocabulary expanded** — 15+ new phrases: "is this GDPR compliant", "check my onboarding", "review my checkout", "is this manipulative", "any dark patterns here", "is my form accessible", and more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<details>
<summary><strong>v1.0.0–v1.2.4</strong> — earlier versions</summary>

### v1.2.4

**New: Category 19 — Ethical Design & Dark Patterns**

20 manipulative patterns across 5 groups: Deceptive Interface, Coercive Flows, Consent & Privacy, False Urgency & Scarcity, Emotional Manipulation.

Ethics severity model: 🔴 Deceptive (−15pts) · 🟡 Questionable (−7pts) · 🟢 Noted (0pts). Ethics Score shown alongside Accessibility Score.

New `ethics.md` reference file — 877 lines with full pattern taxonomy, detection signals, and Ethical Persuasion reference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
