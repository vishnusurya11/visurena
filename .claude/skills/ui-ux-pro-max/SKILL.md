## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

This Skill must be invoked in the following situations:

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Recommended

This Skill is recommended in the following situations:

- UI looks "not professional enough" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality optimization
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip

This Skill is not needed in the following situations:

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

## Edge Cases & Failure Narratives

Real-world scenarios where following the rules isn't enough — because context, combinations, or platform quirks produce unexpected failures. Each entry: **symptom → cause → fix**.

| # | Scenario | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| 1 | **Palette clashes with hero photography** | Brand primary (#2563EB) looks sharp in Figma but fights the warm-toned hero image in production, creating visual mud or eye-strain. | Design tool shows palette swatches in isolation on white; the actual photo introduces competing hues, saturations, and luminance that weren't accounted for. | Test text overlays and CTA colors directly on the real image at the actual viewport size. Use a semi-transparent scrim or gradient over the photo to create a controlled surface, then apply palette colours on top of that neutral layer. |
| 2 | **Dark-mode contrast passes in isolation but fails on images** | Body copy reads fine on `#16181D` surfaces, but the same `#9AA3AF` secondary text becomes invisible when the text is positioned over a dark photograph or video thumbnail. | Contrast tools check foreground vs. a single solid background; images introduce variable luminance regions that can drop below the 4.5:1 ratio without warning. | Never place text directly over uncontrolled imagery without a scrim. Add a `bg-gradient-to-b from-black/60` overlay or solid pill behind the text, then re-verify contrast on the overlay colour, not the photo. |
| 3 | **Bento grid breaks when text exceeds one line** | The grid looks polished with short placeholder copy, but real content (long product names, translated strings 30% longer) causes cells to overflow, collapse neighbours, or lose their aspect ratio. | Grid cells are sized with fixed heights or aspect ratios that assume short copy; `overflow: hidden` silently clips text instead of expanding the cell. | Use `min-h-[...]` not `h-[...]` so cells expand with content. Test with 1.5× and 2× string lengths (for i18n). Add `line-clamp-N` only when you also expose a tooltip/expand path for the full text. |
| 4 | **Touch target passes on mockup, fails on real device** | A 44×44pt button looks fine in Figma and Chrome DevTools mobile emulation, but in-app it's persistently mis-tapped by users. | The device's OS navigation bar or gesture indicator (Android gesture strip, iOS home indicator) overlaps the bottom portion of the screen, shrinking usable viewport height and pushing tap targets into the unsafe zone. | Apply `paddingBottom: insets.bottom` (React Native `useSafeAreaInsets`) or `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` (CSS) to any fixed bottom bar. Test on a physical device with the system navigation bar visible, not only in an emulator. |
| 5 | **SVG icon sizing conflicts with Tailwind `text-` utility** | An inline SVG icon inside a `<span className="text-xl">` renders at an unexpected size — either too large or detached from the surrounding text's visual rhythm. | Tailwind's `text-xl` sets `font-size` and `line-height` on the parent; inline SVGs without explicit `width`/`height` inherit `font-size` as their intrinsic size via the `em` unit, but SVGs with hardcoded `width="24"` ignore it entirely. | Always size SVG icons with explicit Tailwind size utilities (`size-5`, `w-5 h-5`) on the `<svg>` element itself, not via parent `text-` classes. Use `aria-hidden` to keep them out of the accessibility tree and pair with a sibling visible label or `sr-only` span. |
| 6 | **Form error color fails WCAG AA against the chosen palette background** | The design spec calls for `red-500` (`#EF4444`) error text, which looks great on white — but the form sits on a tinted surface (`#FDF2F8` rose-50 or a dark `#1C1917`), and the contrast ratio drops below 4.5:1. | Error colour was validated against pure white, not against the actual form surface colour. Tinted or dark backgrounds shrink the available contrast headroom. | Run the error colour through WebAIM Contrast Checker against the exact surface token, not white. Shift to `red-700` (`#B91C1C`) on light tints and `red-400` (`#F87171`) on dark surfaces. Always pair the colour with an icon (`AlertCircle`) and text so colour is never the sole error indicator (WCAG 1.4.1). |
| 7 | **Spring animation conflicts with SVG path rendering** | A card entrance animation using a spring curve (e.g., Framer Motion `type: "spring"`) causes SVG stroke-dashoffset animations inside the card to stutter, desync, or render blank mid-transition on iOS Safari and low-end Android. | Spring physics-based transforms trigger intermediate composite layers; SVG animations relying on `stroke-dashoffset` or `clip-path` are re-rasterised every frame on some GPU renderers, causing paint budget overruns that manifest as dropped frames or blank frames. | Isolate SVG icon animations on their own `will-change: transform` wrapper separate from the spring container. Prefer `opacity` + `scale` for icon entrance rather than `stroke-dashoffset`. Throttle stagger delays to ≥50ms so both animations don't start simultaneously. Test on a mid-range Android device, not just a flagship or desktop. |

## Quick Visual Reference (no script needed)

Skim these to pick a starting point fast. For the full set (161 palettes, 57 pairings) and reasoning, run `--design-system` / `--domain color` / `--domain typography`. Do **not** paste these in as final values without checking contrast for your text colour.

### Top color palettes by product type

`primary` → main brand/action, `accent` → CTA/highlight, `bg` → page background, `fg` → body text. All pairs in the dataset are tuned toward WCAG AA; re-verify your specific text-on-surface combos.

## How to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests any of the following:

| Scenario | Trigger Examples | Start From |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **New project / page** | "Build a landing page", "Build a dashboard" | Step 1 → Step 2 (design system) |
| **New component** | "Create a pricing card", "Add a modal" | Step 3 (domain search: style, ux) |
| **Choose style / color / font** | "What style fits a fintech app?", "Recommend a color palette" | Step 2 (design system) |
| **Review existing UI** | "Review this page for UX issues", "Check accessibility" | Quick Reference checklist above |
| **Fix a UI bug** | "Button hover is broken", "Layout shifts on load" | Quick Reference → relevant section |
| **Improve / optimize** | "Make this faster", "Improve mobile experience" | Step 3 (domain search: ux, react) |
| **Implement dark mode** | "Add dark mode support" | Step 3 (domain: style "dark mode") |
| **Add charts / data viz** | "Add an analytics dashboard chart" | Step 3 (domain: chart) |
| **Stack best practices** | "React performance tips"、"SwiftUI navigation" | Step 4 (stack search) |

Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: Entertainment (social, video, music, gaming), Tool (scanner, editor, converter), Productivity (task manager, notes, calendar), or hybrid
- **Target audience**: C-end consumer users; consider age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: React Native (this project's only tech stack)

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

**Always start with `--design-system`** to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)

To save the design system for **hierarchical retrieval across sessions**, add `--persist`:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name"
```

This creates:
- `design-system/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth with all design rules
- `design-system/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides

**With page-specific override:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name" --page "dashboard"
```

This also creates:
- `design-system/pages/dashboard.md` — Page-specific deviations from Master

**How hierarchical retrieval works:**
1. When building a specific page (e.g., "Checkout"), first check `design-system/pages/checkout.md`
2. If the page file exists, its rules **override** the Master file
3. If not, use `design-system/MASTER.md` exclusively

**Context-aware retrieval prompt:**
```
I am building the [Page Name] page. Please read design-system/MASTER.md.
Also check if design-system/pages/[page-name].md exists.
If the page file exists, prioritize its rules.
If not, use the Master rules exclusively.
Now, generate the code...
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

After getting the design system, use domain searches to get additional details:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

**When to use detailed searches:**

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Product type patterns | `product` | `--domain product "entertainment social"` |
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "glassmorphism dark"` |
| Color palettes | `color` | `--domain color "entertainment vibrant"` |
| Font pairings | `typography` | `--domain typography "playful modern"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart "real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux "animation accessibility"` |
| Alternative fonts | `typography` | `--domain typography "elegant luxury"` |
| Individual Google Fonts | `google-fonts` | `--domain google-fonts "sans serif popular variable"` |
| Landing structure | `landing` | `--domain landing "hero social-proof"` |
| React Native perf | `react` | `--domain react "rerender memo list"` |
| App interface a11y | `web` | `--domain web "accessibilityLabel touch safe-areas"` |
| AI prompt / CSS keywords | `prompt` | `--domain prompt "minimalism"` |

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines (React Native)

Get React Native implementation-specific best practices:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack react-native
```

### Available Stacks

| Stack | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `react-native` | Components, Navigation, Lists |

---

## Example Workflow

**User request:** "Make an AI search homepage."

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
- Product type: Tool (AI search engine)
- Target audience: C-end users looking for fast, intelligent search
- Style keywords: modern, minimal, content-first, dark mode
- Stack: React Native

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "AI search tool modern minimal" --design-system -p "AI Search"
```

**Output:** Complete design system with pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, and anti-patterns.

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

```bash
# Get style options for a modern tool product
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "minimalism dark mode" --domain style

# Get UX best practices for search interaction and loading
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "search loading animation" --domain ux
```

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "list performance navigation" --stack react-native
```

**Then:** Synthesize design system + detailed searches and implement the design.

---

## Output Formats

The `--design-system` flag supports two output formats:

```bash
# ASCII box (default) - best for terminal display
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system

# Markdown - best for documentation
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system -f markdown
```

---

## Tips for Better Results

### Query Strategy

- Use **multi-dimensional keywords** — combine product + industry + tone + density: `"entertainment social vibrant content-dense"` not just `"app"`
- Try different keywords for the same need: `"playful neon"` → `"vibrant dark"` → `"content-first minimal"`
- Use `--design-system` first for full recommendations, then `--domain` to deep-dive any dimension you're unsure about
- Always add `--stack react-native` for implementation-specific guidance

### Common Sticking Points

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Can't decide on style/color | Re-run `--design-system` with different keywords |
| Dark mode contrast issues | Quick Reference §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | Quick Reference §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | Quick Reference §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | Quick Reference §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | Quick Reference §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | Quick Reference §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

### Pre-Delivery Checklist

- Run `--domain ux "animation accessibility z-index loading"` as a UX validation pass before implementation
- Run through Quick Reference **§1–§3** (CRITICAL + HIGH) as a final review
- Test on 375px (small phone) and landscape orientation
- Verify behavior with **reduced-motion** enabled and **Dynamic Type** at largest size
- Check dark mode contrast independently (don't assume light mode values work)
- Confirm all touch targets ≥44pt and no content hidden behind safe areas

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:
Scope notice: The rules below are for App UI (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter), not desktop-web interaction patterns.

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Standard | Avoid | Why It Matters |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **No Emoji as Structural Icons** | Use vector-based icons (e.g., Lucide, react-native-vector-icons, @expo/vector-icons). | Using emojis (🎨 🚀 ⚙️) for navigation, settings, or system controls. | Emojis are font-dependent, inconsistent across platforms, and cannot be controlled via design tokens. |
| **Vector-Only Assets** | Use SVG or platform vector icons that scale cleanly and support theming. | Raster PNG icons that blur or pixelate. | Ensures scalability, crisp rendering, and dark/light mode adaptability. |
| **Stable Interaction States** | Use color, opacity, or elevation transitions for press states without changing layout bounds. | Layout-shifting transforms that move surrounding content or trigger visual jitter. | Prevents unstable interactions and preserves smooth motion/perceived quality on mobile. |
| **Correct Brand Logos** | Use official brand assets and follow their usage guidelines (spacing, color, clear space). | Guessing logo paths, recoloring unofficially, or modifying proportions. | Prevents brand misuse and ensures legal/platform compliance. |
| **Consistent Icon Sizing** | Define icon sizes as design tokens (e.g., icon-sm, icon-md = 24pt, icon-lg). | Mixing arbitrary values like 20pt / 24pt / 28pt randomly. | Maintains rhythm and visual hierarchy across the interface. |
| **Stroke Consistency** | Use a consistent stroke width within the same visual layer (e.g., 1.5px or 2px). | Mixing thick and thin stroke styles arbitrarily. | Inconsistent strokes reduce perceived polish and cohesion. |
| **Filled vs Outline Discipline** | Use one icon style per hierarchy level. | Mixing filled and outline icons at the same hierarchy level. | Maintains semantic clarity and stylistic coherence. |
| **Touch Target Minimum** | Minimum 44×44pt interactive area (use hitSlop if icon is smaller). | Small icons without expanded tap area. | Meets accessibility and platform usability standards. |
| **Icon Alignment** | Align icons to text baseline and maintain consistent padding. | Misaligned icons or inconsistent spacing around them. | Prevents subtle visual imbalance that reduces perceived quality. |
| **Icon Contrast** | Follow WCAG contrast standards: 4.5:1 for small elements, 3:1 minimum for larger UI glyphs. | Low-contrast icons that blend into the background. | Ensures accessibility in both light and dark modes. |


### Interaction (App)

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Tap feedback** | Provide clear pressed feedback (ripple/opacity/elevation) within 80-150ms | No visual response on tap |
| **Animation timing** | Keep micro-interactions around 150-300ms with platform-native easing | Instant transitions or slow animations (>500ms) |
| **Accessibility focus** | Ensure screen reader focus order matches visual order and labels are descriptive | Unlabeled controls or confusing focus traversal |
| **Disabled state clarity** | Use disabled semantics (`disabled`/native disabled props), reduced emphasis, and no tap action | Controls that look tappable but do nothing |
| **Touch target minimum** | Keep tap areas >=44x44pt (iOS) or >=48x48dp (Android), expand hit area when icon is smaller | Tiny tap targets or icon-only hit areas without padding |
| **Gesture conflict prevention** | Keep one primary gesture per region and avoid nested tap/drag conflicts | Overlapping gestures causing accidental actions |
| **Semantic native controls** | Prefer native interactive primitives (`Button`, `Pressable`, platform equivalents) with proper accessibility roles | Generic containers used as primary controls without semantics |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Surface readability (light)** | Keep cards/surfaces clearly separated from background with sufficient opacity/elevation | Overly transparent surfaces that blur hierarchy |
| **Text contrast (light)** | Maintain body text contrast >=4.5:1 against light surfaces | Low-contrast gray body text |
| **Text contrast (dark)** | Maintain primary text contrast >=4.5:1 and secondary text >=3:1 on dark surfaces | Dark mode text that blends into background |
| **Border and divider visibility** | Ensure separators are visible in both themes (not just light mode) | Theme-specific borders disappearing in one mode |
| **State contrast parity** | Keep pressed/focused/disabled states equally distinguishable in light and dark themes | Defining interaction states for one theme only |
| **Token-driven theming** | Use semantic color tokens mapped per theme across app surfaces/text/icons | Hardcoded per-screen hex values |
| **Scrim and modal legibility** | Use a modal scrim strong enough to isolate foreground content (typically 40-60% black) | Weak scrim that leaves background visually competing |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Safe-area compliance** | Respect top/bottom safe areas for all fixed headers, tab bars, and CTA bars | Placing fixed UI under notch, status bar, or gesture area |
| **System bar clearance** | Add spacing for status/navigation bars and gesture home indicator | Let tappable content collide with OS chrome |
| **Consistent content width** | Keep predictable content width per device class (phone/tablet) | Mixing arbitrary widths between screens |
| **8dp spacing rhythm** | Use a consistent 4/8dp spacing system for padding/gaps/section spacing | Random spacing increments with no rhythm |
| **Readable text measure** | Keep long-form text readable on large devices (avoid edge-to-edge paragraphs on tablets) | Full-width long text that hurts readability |
| **Section spacing hierarchy** | Define clear vertical rhythm tiers (e.g., 16/24/32/48) by hierarchy | Similar UI levels with inconsistent spacing |
| **Adaptive gutters by breakpoint** | Increase horizontal insets on larger widths and in landscape | Same narrow gutter on all device sizes/orientations |
| **Scroll and fixed element coexistence** | Add bottom/top content insets so lists are not hidden behind fixed bars | Scroll content obscured by sticky headers/footers |

---

## Before / After Examples (code)

Concrete transformations applying the rules above. Each shows the common mistake and the fixed version.

### 1. Button — accessibility, states, semantics (React + Tailwind)

```tsx
// ❌ BEFORE: div as button, no keyboard/focus, hover-only feedback, low-contrast text,
//            instant state change, emoji icon
<div className="bg-blue-400 text-blue-100 rounded px-3 py-1 hover:bg-blue-500"
     onClick={save}>
  💾 Save
</div>
```
```tsx
// ✅ AFTER: real <button>, visible focus ring (≥3:1), disabled + loading states,
//           AA contrast, 150–250ms transition, SVG icon, 44px min height
<button
  onClick={save}
  disabled={isSaving}
  className="inline-flex h-11 items-center gap-2 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 px-4
             text-white font-medium transition-colors duration-200 ease-out
             hover:bg-blue-700 active:bg-blue-800
             focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-blue-600
             disabled:opacity-45 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  {isSaving ? <Spinner className="size-4" /> : <Save className="size-4" aria-hidden />}
  {isSaving ? "Saving…" : "Save"}
</button>
```
Why: `#60A5FA` text on `#3B82F6` ≈ fails AA; `blue-600`/white passes. `div` has no role/keyboard. `focus-visible` shows a ring for keyboard users only. (WCAG [2.4.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/), [1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html); [MD3 state layers](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction/states/overview))

### 2. Form input — label, validation, mobile keyboard, error a11y (HTML)

```html
<!-- ❌ BEFORE: placeholder as label (vanishes on type), wrong keyboard, error far away, no a11y -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Email" class="border p-2">
<div class="errors">Invalid input</div>
```
```html
<!-- ✅ AFTER: persistent visible label, semantic type=email (correct mobile keyboard + autofill),
              error tied to field via aria-describedby, role=alert, actionable message -->
<label for="email" class="block text-sm font-medium text-slate-700">Email</label>
<input id="email" name="email" type="email" autocomplete="email" inputmode="email"
       aria-invalid="true" aria-describedby="email-err"
       class="mt-1 block w-full rounded-lg border border-slate-300 px-3 py-2
              focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-blue-600">
<p id="email-err" role="alert" class="mt-1 text-sm text-red-600">
  Enter an address like name@example.com
</p>
```
Why: placeholders aren't labels (lost on input, low contrast). `type=email` + `inputmode` triggers the right keyboard and autofill. `aria-describedby` + `role="alert"` makes errors announce to screen readers. ([Apple HIG: Text fields](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/text-fields); WCAG error identification)

### 3. Card hover — kill layout shift, respect reduced motion (CSS)

```css
/* ❌ BEFORE: animates height/margin → reflows neighbours, janky, ignores reduced-motion */
.card { transition: all .4s; }
.card:hover { margin-top: -6px; height: 320px; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,.3); }
```
```css
/* ✅ AFTER: transform/opacity only (GPU, no reflow), tasteful timing, reduced-motion guard */
.card {
  transition: transform .2s ease-out, box-shadow .2s ease-out;
  will-change: transform;
}
.card:hover { transform: translateY(-6px); box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgb(0 0 0 / .12); }
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card { transition: none; }
  .card:hover { transform: none; }
}
```
Why: animating `height`/`margin`/`top` triggers layout + paint every frame (CLS, jank). `transform`/`opacity` are compositor-only. Always provide a reduced-motion path. ([MD3 motion](https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/overview))

### 4. Dark-mode colour — tonal, not inverted; semantic tokens (CSS)

```css
/* ❌ BEFORE: hard invert → pure-black bg + pure-white text vibrates; raw hex per component */
.dark .panel { background: #000; color: #fff; }
.dark .panel .label { color: #1f2937; } /* now unreadable on black */
```
```css
/* ✅ AFTER: desaturated dark surfaces, off-white text, semantic tokens reused everywhere */
:root         { --surface: #ffffff; --on-surface: #1e293b; --on-surface-muted: #475569; }
.dark         { --surface: #16181d; --on-surface: #e6e8eb; --on-surface-muted: #9aa3af; }
.panel        { background: var(--surface); color: var(--on-surface); }
.panel .label { color: var(--on-surface-muted); } /* still ≥4.5:1 in both themes */
```
Why: dark mode uses lighter/desaturated tonal variants, not inverted values; pure #000/#fff causes halation. Drive both themes from one token set so contrast holds. ([MD3 color roles](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles); Apple HIG Dark Mode)

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before delivering UI code, verify these items:
Scope notice: This checklist is for App UI (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter).

### Visual Quality
- [ ] No emojis used as icons (use SVG instead)
- [ ] All icons come from a consistent icon family and style
- [ ] Official brand assets are used with correct proportions and clear space
- [ ] Pressed-state visuals do not shift layout bounds or cause jitter
- [ ] Semantic theme tokens are used consistently (no ad-hoc per-screen hardcoded colors)

### Interaction
- [ ] All tappable elements provide clear pressed feedback (ripple/opacity/elevation)
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size (>=44x44pt iOS, >=48x48dp Android)
- [ ] Micro-interaction timing stays in the 150-300ms range with native-feeling easing
- [ ] Disabled states are visually clear and non-interactive
- [ ] Screen reader focus order matches visual order, and interactive labels are descriptive
- [ ] Gesture regions avoid nested/conflicting interactions (tap/drag/back-swipe conflicts)

### Light/Dark Mode
- [ ] Primary text contrast >=4.5:1 in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Secondary text contrast >=3:1 in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Dividers/borders and interaction states are distinguishable in both modes
- [ ] Modal/drawer scrim opacity is strong enough to preserve foreground legibility (typically 40-60% black)
- [ ] Both themes are tested before delivery (not inferred from a single theme)

### Layout
- [ ] Safe areas are respected for headers, tab bars, and bottom CTA bars
- [ ] Scroll content is not hidden behind fixed/sticky bars
- [ ] Verified on small phone, large phone, and tablet (portrait + landscape)
- [ ] Horizontal insets/gutters adapt correctly by device size and orientation
- [ ] 4/8dp spacing rhythm is maintained across component, section, and page levels
- [ ] Long-form text measure remains readable on larger devices (no edge-to-edge paragraphs)

### Accessibility
- [ ] All meaningful images/icons have accessibility labels
- [ ] Form fields have labels, hints, and clear error messages
- [ ] Color is not the only indicator
- [ ] Reduced motion and dynamic text size are supported without layout breakage
- [ ] Accessibility traits/roles/states (selected, disabled, expanded) are announced correctly
